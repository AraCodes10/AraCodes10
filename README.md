- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AraCodes10 but you can call me Junior.
- ðŸ‘€ I got into coding just a few months ago and since then, I am ADDICTED.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning php, javascript basically to create websites. I created my first website from scratch and it was amazing.
- I am a junior in coding so there is a lot for me to learn. But I am excited about it and I would love to help others in their projects.

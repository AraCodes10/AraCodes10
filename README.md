- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Arakhsh Qanit, a junior web developer.
- ðŸ‘€ I got into coding just a few months ago and I love the feeling of happiness when my code works.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning php, javascript basically to create websites. I already know much about HTML and CSS. I created my first website from scratch and it was amazing.
- I am a junior in coding so there is a lot for me to learn. But I am excited about it and I would love to help others in their projects.
